      Connor built this from scratch! You may not know this, but he is a programmer now.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      He wanted to put a personal touch on this wedding website. He also wanted to learn how to
      build websites from scratch (he hasn't done much of that before). He also wanted to try out
      some new tech with very kind free tiers. He also wanted to save a few bucks on those wedding
      website services.

    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      He definitely overthought it and got too fixated on making things configurable to the point
      where he reinvented a worse version of The Knot. But, that means you theoretically could use
      it yourself if you wanted, for free! All you pay is for your domain name.

    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      There is a link to the github at the bottom of the page, you can click it to see all the code
      and some setup instructions. It's probably overkill if you're not somewhat technical, but hey,
      it's an option! You can contact Connor directly if you are interested, he is happy to help and
      can get you set up relatively quickly. Once the site is set up, you don't need any coding or
      anything, you can do everything from an admin section on the site. The admin interface lets
      you change colors, fonts, add pages, upload photos, and manage RSVPs.

      He wrote about his whole experience building this thing, check out <a

        class="text-primary hover:underline"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">JOURNEY.md</a
      > on GitHub. It's got all of Connor's opinions - maybe useful if you're building something similar!
