      Connor built this from scratch! You may not know this, but he is a programmer now. He wanted
      to put a personal touch on his wedding website. He also wanted to learn how to build websites
      from scratch (he hasn't done much of that before). He also wanted to try out some new tech
      with very kind free tiers. He also wanted to save a few bucks on those wedding website
      services.

    <p class="mb-4">
      He definitely overthought it and got too fixated on making things configurable to the point
      where he reinvented a worse version of The Knot. But, that means you theoretically could use
      it yourself if you wanted, for free! All you pay is for your domain name. There is a link to
      the github at the bottom of the page, you can click it to see all the code and some setup
      instructions. It's probably overkill if you're not somewhat technical, but hey, it's an
      option! You can contact Connor directly if you are interested, he is happy to help and can get
      you set up quite fast. Once the site is set up, you don't need any coding or anything, you can
      do everything from an admin section on the site. The admin interface lets you change colors,
      fonts, add pages, upload photos, and manage RSVPs without needing to know what HTML stands
      for.
